                    Chemical engineering is a branch of engineering which deals with the study of design and operation of chemical plants as well as methods of improving production. Chemical engineers develop economical commercial processes to convert raw material into useful products. Chemical engineering uses principles of chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology, and economics to efficiently use, produce, design, transport and transform energy and materials. The work of chemical engineers can range from the utilization of nanotechnology and nanomaterials in the laboratory to large-scale industrial processes that convert chemicals, raw materials, living cells, microorganisms, and energy into useful forms and products. Chemical engineers are involved in many aspects of plant design and operation, including safety and hazard assessments, process design and analysis, modeling, control engineering, chemical reaction engineering, nuclear engineering, biological engineering, construction specification, and operating instructions. Chemical engineers typically hold a degree in Chemical Engineering or Process Engineering. Practicing engineers may have professional certification and be accredited members of a professional body. Such bodies include the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) or the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE). A degree in chemical engineering is directly linked with all of the other engineering disciplines, to various extents.

                    A 1996 British Journal for the History of Science article cites James F. Donnelly for mentioning an
                    1839
                    reference to chemical engineering in relation to the production of sulfuric acid. In the same paper,
                    however, George E. Davis, an English consultant, was credited with having coined the term. Davis
                    also
                    tried to found a Society of Chemical Engineering, but instead it was named the Society of Chemical
                    Industry (1881), with Davis as its first secretary. The History of Science in United States: An
                    Encyclopedia puts the use of the term around 1890. "Chemical engineering", describing the use of
                    mechanical equipment in the chemical industry, became common vocabulary in England after 1850. By
                    1910,
                    the profession, "chemical engineer," was already in common use in Britain and the United States.

                    Chemical engineering emerged upon the development of unit operations, a fundamental concept of the
                    discipline of chemical engineering. Most authors agree that Davis invented the concept of unit
                    operations if not substantially developed it.[8] He gave a series of lectures on unit operations at
                    the
                    Manchester Technical School (later part of University of Manchester Institute of Science and
                    Technology
                    and now the University of Manchester) in 1887, considered to be one of the earliest such about
                    chemical
                    engineering. Three years before Davis' lectures, Henry Edward Armstrong taught a degree course in
                    chemical engineering at the City and Guilds of London Institute. Armstrong's course failed simply
                    because its graduates were not especially attractive to employers. Employers of the time would have
                    rather hired chemists and mechanical engineers. Courses in chemical engineering offered by
                    Massachusetts
                    Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States, Owens College in Manchester, England, and
                    University
                    College London suffered under similar circumstances.
                    Students inside an industrial chemistry laboratory at MIT

                    Starting from 1888, Lewis M. Norton taught at MIT the first chemical engineering course in the
                    United
                    States. Norton's course was contemporaneous and essentially similar to Armstrong's course. Both
                    courses,
                    however, simply merged chemistry and engineering subjects along with product design. "Its
                    practitioners
                    had difficulty convincing engineers that they were engineers and chemists that they were not simply
                    chemists." Unit operations was introduced into the course by William Hultz Walker in 1905. By the
                    early
                    1920s, unit operations became an important aspect of chemical engineering at MIT and other US
                    universities, as well as at Imperial College London. The American Institute of Chemical Engineers
                    (AIChE), established in 1908, played a key role in making chemical engineering considered an
                    independent
                    science, and unit operations central to chemical engineering. For instance, it defined chemical
                    engineering to be a "science of itself, the basis of which is unit operations" in a 1922 report; and
                    with which principle, it had published a list of academic institutions which offered "satisfactory"
                    chemical engineering courses. Meanwhile, promoting chemical engineering as a distinct science in
                    Britain
                    led to the establishment of the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) in 1922. IChemE likewise
                    helped make unit operations considered essential to the discipline.

                    Chemical engineers "develop economic ways of using materials and energy".Chemical engineers use
                    chemistry and engineering to turn raw materials into usable products, such as medicine,
                    petrochemicals,
                    and plastics on a large-scale, industrial setting. They are also involved in waste management and
                    research. Both applied and research facets could make extensive use of computers.
                    Chemical engineers may be involved in industry or university research where they are tasked with
                    designing and performing experiments to create better and safer methods for production, pollution
                    control, and resource conservation. They may be involved in designing and constructing plants as a
                    project engineer. Chemical engineers serving as project engineers use their knowledge in selecting
                    optimal production methods and plant equipment to minimize costs and maximize safety and
                    profitability.
                    After plant construction, chemical engineering project managers may be involved in equipment
                    upgrades,
                    process changes, troubleshooting, and daily operations in either full-time or consulting roles
